# Starter template for Terraform on Azure

This is a starter template meant to help get started with new Terraform on Azure projects.

This repo includes a [dev container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) meant for use with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [Visual Studio CodeSpaces](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/services/visual-studio-codespaces/). 

## Generating the dev container

1. In VS Code, run `CTRL+SHIFT+P -> Remote-Containers: Add Development Container Configuration Files...`.

2. Click "Show All Definitions..." if needed and select "Devcontainer Terraform".
